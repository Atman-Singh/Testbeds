# TitanWare2020

This repository will hold the code for team 1683's 2020 Robot


 
## PathWeaver
To create paths, first run

`gradlew PathWeaverInstall`

then run 

`gradlew PathWeaver`



If it asks, set both project and output directories as the root of robot code project.
(i.e. the `TitanWare2020` folder)  

**(!!!) We NEED to make some IMPORTANT changes before using PathWeaver (!!!)**
Changes
* setting the length units away from meters
* setting the true max velocity of our robot 
* setting the true max accel of our robot 
* setting the true wheel base distance of our robot
