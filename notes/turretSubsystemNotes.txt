turret subsystem

components: 
- wheel motor to shoot
- assuming z is up and down dimension, z axis rotation motor
- aim up and down motor (hood)
- belt motor - move belt to get ball to shooter
- all motor controllers talon


Sensors:
- Encoder used for z axis rotation motor to determine angle
- Encoder used on hood motor to find angle of hood
- Presence sensor (laser ) n for belt to check if ball is available, may be harder for mechanical to implement: alternative is encoder
